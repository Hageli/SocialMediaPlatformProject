# Social Media Platform Project
This personal project utilizes the MERN stack. Users are able to create accounts and login using Json Web Token authentication, and post content into a global feed. Users can also add each other as friends. No fancy functionality is added, but the UI includes elements where additional functionality could be included. Image uploading to the system is done using multer.
